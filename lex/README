The definitions for the lexical database are in:
================================================

lexdb.fld	The fields
lexdb.dfn	The links to the grammar
Jacy.rev	The contents
generics.tdl	Generic entries (not stored in the database)

See <http://wiki.delph-in.net/moin/LkbLexDb> for deeper explanation.

The database is called "jacy" and is encoded in UNICODE.

Currently (2007-10-25) all the *.tdl files apart from the generics.tdl
are not being used, and are bundled in for historical interest only.
Their format is quite different from the current lexicon.

Note: the lexdb.fld file only lists the optional fields.  The full set
(used in the table lex and dumped into Jacy.rev) is:

name  
userid 
modstamp
type 
orthography 
keyrel
keytag 
altkey 
alt2key 
altkeytag 
compkey 
idiom 
pronunciation 
comments 
lang 
country 
dialect 
confidence
