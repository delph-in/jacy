The definitions for the lexical database are in:
================================================

lexdb.fld	The fields
lexdb.dfn	The links to the grammar
Jacy.rev	The contents
generics.tdl	Generic entries (not stored in the database)

See <http://wiki.delph-in.net/moin/LkbLexDb> for deeper explanation.

The database is called "jacy" and is encoded in UNICODE.

Currently (2007-10-25) all the *.tdl files apart from the generics.tdl
are not being used, and are bundled in for historical interest only.
