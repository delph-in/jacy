Performace tweaks				 Francis Bond
-----------------

Make sure the two quick-check files are kept up to date.

LKB:	japanese/lkb/checkpaths.lsp
PET:	japanese/pet/qc.tdl


Generate as follows:
====================
PET (hinoki):
-------------
Make sure:
 - you are using compatible versions of flop and cheap
 - your grammar is up-to-date:
   flop japanese.tdl

mv pet/qc.tdl pet/qc.tdl.old

cut -d@ -f 7 ~/delphin/hinoki/skeletons/test-a/item | head -100 | \
cheap -compute-qc=pet/qc.tdl japanese


### can do this for vanilla, but need to have the chasen preprocessor
cut -d@ -f 7 tsdb/skeletons/vanilla/item | cheap -compute-qc=pet/qc.tdl japanese

After you have made the quick check file, you need to rebuild the grammar
flop japanese.tdl


LKB:
----
(see Copestake (2002), indexed under checkpaths)


mv lkb/checkpaths.lsp pet/checkpaths.lsp.old

from within the *common-lisp* buffer:

(lkb::with-check-path-list-collection 
   "~/delphin/grammars/japanese/lkb/checkpaths" 
   (parse-sentences 
      "~/delphin/grammars/japanese/testsuites/hinoki-test-a.100" 
      "~/delphin/grammars/japanese/testsuites/hinoki-test-a.100.results"))
