Discussion and developments on relative clauses:

; (ERB 2002-01-02) Allowing relative clauses to attach to either
; NP or N'.  Need to constrain the quantify-n-infl-rule so that
; it only applies to unmodified elements, to avoid spurious ambiguity.

; (ERB 2002-01-02) [NUCL -] on mother --- see notes at 
; head-adjunct-rule-type.

; (ERB 2002-01-14) It may be desirable to split the relative clause rule in two
; to prefer low attachment of relative clauses: rel-cl-rule-1 requires a [NUCL
; +] head daughter, while rel-cl-rule-2 requires a [NUCL -] head
; daughter.

; 2) NUCL not_fin_conj
; 3) The co-indexing of #adjevent to CONT.HOOK.INDEX instead of ARG0.

; (MS 2003-11-27) This introduces loads of spurious ambiguity. Parallel to the treatment of 
; topicalizing, it is not possible to decide on the argument binding in relative sentence
; on the syntactic base. Using selectional restrictions, it should be possible to set up 
; preferences, but these belong to another level on processing.

Emily:

Yes -- that is my recollection of our analysis of relative
clauses as well.  Tim Baldwin eventually convinced me that
there were a few cases in which you actually need a syntactic
long distance dependencies (something to do with constraints ga-no
conversion, I think, and maybe some other cases) but it seemed
to me that overgenerating a bit in those cases was better than
the extensive ambiguity introduced by allowing the long-distance
dependencies to any missing (i.e., pro-dropped) argument in
the relative clause.  Furthermore, you need something like
the topic relation in the case of RCs like (i), which would
add an extra reading everywhere, too.

(i) atama ga yoku naru hon

(Did we write about this in the Coling paper?  I can't remember.)

Francis:

We are not happy with the implementation - we would like to have one
rule that can takes anything left from the subcat list rather than two
rules.  But that is a separate issue.

We discussed this a fair bit before we did this.  The unavoidable
ambiguity is nasty, and we definitely felt it treebanking.  However,
the consenus was that in a construction like "akai hon", there is
really no ambiguity or vagueness - the ONLY interpretation we wanted
was the gapped one.  What we want to do is find something that will
restrict the application of the vague rule to the cases where it is
needed "atama-ga yoku naru hon", "sakana-wo yaku nioi" .  We haven't
done that yet (^_^).  We are also interested in how often we can get
the correct selection using the stochastic model and treebank - just
because we get the same ambiguity everytime doesn't mean it has to be
ranked the same.  In fact, I would like to try the same with topic at
some stage...

However, I realise that we may not reach consensus here, and suggest
that we might consider a tiny fork - have an experimental hen.tdl and
two scripts, one which doesn't load that one (ascript) and one that
does (nscript) so we can keep the wierd stuff separate.
